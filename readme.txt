This projet is an end year engineer project. The idea is to :
 - write a caractere on a white board, detect it, process it and find with a neural network with one is it ("/PROG/Neural_Network_Renderer" on Qt with Cuda and opencv2)
 - send the sting in bluetooth to a robot (Turtlebot3 with a WidowXl on it)
 - the robot start to write the caractere on an other white board, place itself in space with an path following algorithm (that use the lidar LDS-01), 
   use inverse kinematic to write numbers (preview "PROG/SequenceGenerator" on Qt)

 - codes of the Turtlebot3 is at "PROG/CodeOpenCR" and of the WidowXL is at "PROG\CodeArmWidowXL"
 - Matlab codes of the path following is at "PRJ_AUTOM"
 - Matlab code of the power consumption is at "PRJ_MOBI"
 - file to configure the RPI3B+ (Robot commander) and the Jetson Nano (Neural Network part) with the camera pi v2 are at "DRIVER"
 - 3D print file of the end effector of the WidowXL is at "CAO"
